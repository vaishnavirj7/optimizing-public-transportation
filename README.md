Optimizing Public Transportation

A stream processing application that shows the status of trains in real time.


# Public Transit Status with Apache Kafka 
In this project, we will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/) we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.
